# Python Implementation of Causal Fairness Analysis (CFA)

This is a Python implementation of the Causal Fairness Analysis (CFA) paper, based on the original R package. 

## Structure

- `faircause/`: Source code for the Python implementation
- `tests/`: Test files
- `examples/`: Example notebooks and scripts

## Dependencies

Listed in setup.py

## Implementation Status

Currently:
- Writing unit tests for fairprediction (CFA task 2 implementation)
- Benchmarking different implementations
- One-step debiased estimation in additon to mdml
- Implementing Fioretta

## Usage

Please review the notebooks in vignettes for examples. With a few differences, the usage is also fairly similar to the R package, so interested individuals may also review the documentation for the R package if desired. 

## Development

This is a work in progress. The implementation follows the methodology described in the original R package and paper
